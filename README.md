### Hey there, I'm Gordon  👋
I'm the [Informatics Team Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmcdonald/) at the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-informatics-hub), which is part of the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au). We consult in AI, data science, visualisation and machine learning projects for academic researchers in all disciplines. My team and I work with external collaborators like government departments, hospitals, police, and NGOs. Together with my team I've [built native animal species detection models for camera trap images](https://marsupial-ai.github.io/web/), mapped [fish behaviour in a tank 🐟](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/145571/3/rspb.2019.0448.pdf), [global mine waste 🌏 ⛏](https://tailing.grida.no/) or [mercury levels](https://gdmcdonald.github.io/mercury/), and automated high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy 💉 to detect metabolites more efficiently, and looked at [hospital](https://dhin.net.au/project-update-speed-extract/) [patient](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/8/1326/pdf) [data](https://adc.bmj.com/content/104/12/1150.abstract) 🏥 to get them better outcomes.

I completed my PhD in Physics with the [Atom Laser and Quantum Sensors group](http://atomlaser.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian National University. I used Bose-Einstein condensates to [build](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.013002) [new](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2143) [designs](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/7/073035) of [sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0268) known as [atom interferometers](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/152398/2/01_Hardman_Simultaneous_Precision_2016.pdf). These can be used to measure gravity (to find mineral and water 🌊 deposits, gravity waves 🌠), inertial accelerations (guidance systems 🛰, geology), magnetic 🧲 and electric fields ⚡️, and fundamental physical constants (fine structure, big G ⏱ ). One day they will be inside all sorts of technology in everyday life.

I currently spend much of my time engaging with national collaborative research infrastructure partners including:
- 🧬 [BioPlatforms Australia](https://bioplatforms.com) and the [Australian Biocommons](http://biocommons.org.au) - $10m funding to deliver the [BioCloud platform](https://www.biocommons.org.au/biocloud) for which we now have a USyd node within Sydney Informatics Hub.
-	📖 [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au) through the [Community Data Lab](https://ardc.edu.au/project/ardc-community-data-lab/) the [Language Data Commons of Australia](http://ldaca.edu.au), with which we have a team working within SIH on the Australian Text Analytics Platform, and Nectar research cloud.
-	🌱 Australian Plant Phenomics Network, with which we now have a [USyd Node at SIH and Narrabri](https://www.plantphenomics.org.au/our-nodes/university-of-sydney).

As well as providing leadership in the use of Generative AI 🤖 in research:
-	[Gen-AI workshops and talks](https://github.com/gdmcdonald/Talks/blob/main/README.md) for researchers around the uni, nationally, and internationally.
-	Co-chairing a uni-wide Generative AI coordinating group
- 📄 Driving and/or contributing to 11 national submissions on behalf of the university.
- 🤝 Leading AI + strategic collaboration projects with other parts of the University.
