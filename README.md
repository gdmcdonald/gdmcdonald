### Hey there, I'm Gordon  👋
I'm a ![Data Science Group Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmcdonald/) at the ![Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-informatics-hub), which is part of the University of Sydney. We consult in data science, visualisation and machine learning projects for academic researchers in all disciplines. Sometimes we work with external collaborators like government departments, hospitals and the police. Some days I’m mapping ![fish behaviour in a tank 🐟](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/145571/3/rspb.2019.0448.pdf), ![global mine waste 🌏 ⛏](https://tailing.grida.no/) or ![mercury levels](https://marine-studies-institute.sydney.edu.au/mercury-database/), other days I’m automating high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy 💉 to detect metabolites more efficiently, and some time in between I’m looking at hospital patient data 🏥 to get them better outcomes.

I completed my PhD in Physics with the Atom Laser and Quantum Sensors group at the Australian National University. I used Bose-Einstein condensates to build new designs of sensors known as atom interferometers. These can be used to measure gravity (to find mineral and water 🌊 deposits, gravity waves 🌠), inertial accelerations (guidance systems 🛰, geology), magnetic 🧲 and electric fields ⚡️, and fundamental physical constants (fine structure, big G ⏱ ). One day they will be inside all sorts of technology in everyday life.
